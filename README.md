# School-of-Salamanca-word-frequencies
Word frequencies in the Digital Collection of Sources in the Works of the School of Salamanca.

This project aims to give a quantitive analysis of lemmas extracted from a digital comparable corpus. 
The content of this data collection is related to law, politics, religion, and ethics, which are the core of early modern discourse of School of Salamanca 
These early modern texts  serve to analyze the history of the Salamanca School's origins and influence, as well as its internal discourse contexts within the context of the future.

This objective is achieved through the use of NLP applications, such as lemmatization and frequency distribution of lemmas, extracted from 16th-17th century Latin and Spanish texts. 

This repository displays the results, namely, 100 most common lemmas, obtained from this applied methodology, as long as the list of stop words and corrected Latin/Spanish names (used in the normalization process), the text formats used for before mentioned NLP tasks.
