# School-of-Salamanca-word-frequencies
Word frequencies in the Digital Collection of Sources in the Works of the School of Salamanca.

This project aims to give a quantitive analysis of lemmas extracted from a digital comparable corpus. 
The content of this data collection is related to law, politics, religion, and ethics, which are the core of early modern discourse of the School of Salamanca. 
These early modern texts  serve to analyze the history of the Salamanca School's origins and influence, as well as its internal discourse contexts within the context of the future.

This objective was achieved through the use of NLP applications, such as lemmatization and frequency distribution of lemmas, extracted from 16th-17th century Latin and Spanish works. 

This repository displays the results, namely, 100 most common lemmas, obtained from the applied methodology, as long as the list of stop words and corrected Latin/Spanish names, which were used in the normalization process, the text format and python codes, through which the data collection was processed.
